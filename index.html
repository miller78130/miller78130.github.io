  <p>Born in San Antonio. Raised near China Grove. Spent 4 1/2 years in the Navy. Worked 13 years in civilian aviation. Worked 8 years in the oil field.
    I have spent the last 6 months working in both the oil field and fiber optics splicing.</p>
  <p>In my spare time I enjoy working in the yard, making my yard the greenest in the neighborhood. I also enjoy spending time in backyard BBQing
    and having drinks on the back porch.
